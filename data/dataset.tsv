https://finderhub.com.au/things-to-do-in-great-ocean-road/	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorne,_Victoria	The Great Ocean Road Museum	Lorne, Victoria	"The town has two pubs (The Grand Pacific Hotel and Lorne Hotel) and a number of cafes, restaurants, and bakeries, mostly located along Mountjoy Parade. The town is serviced by one supermarket with a reasonable range of products, given the wide range of needs from locals to camping families to passing motorists. They stock local products such as breads and preserves. Other stores sell more local fruits, vegetables, cheese, and there are bakeries. As usual in a tourist town, there is a large number of boutiques and clothing stores, as well as a book store, art galleries, and craft shops. There are also more regular shops such as real estate agents, a pharmacy, and post office.
Lorne has The Great Ocean Road Museum, which describes the history of the road. Things to do in Lorne include strolling along the Great Ocean Road, visiting the Lorne Pier, surfing or exploring the Otway Ranges National Park. There are also many art galleries and cultural events to enjoy.[9]"
http://get.syr.edu/	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Waterfall_model	http://get.syr.edu/	Talk:Waterfall model	"The ending of the Criticism section currently says: ""While advocates of agile software development argue the waterfall model is an ineffective process for developing software, some sceptics suggest that the waterfall model is a false argument used purely to market alternative development methodologies"" There are plenty of valid criticisms of Agile but the idea that Agile is just a marketing ploy is one I've never heard anyone seriously make. I went to check that reference and it goes to a dead link. Given that there is no actual source information anyway (there is an author but nothing like the name of the source cite, it looks like just a URL to the site: http://get.syr.edu/ which is no longer a site at all). The link is archived to Wayback but still goes to a dead link. Given that this looks to me like it isn't a valid source even if we could find it in the bowels of the web and that this is not what in my experience constitutes a serious argument (anymore than I would consider the same argument applied to Waterfall to be a serious argument) I'm going to delete that claim.

Both have long histories, with the Aardvarks celebrating their 50th anniversary in 2016, and the Rochester Colonials celebrating 40 years in 2020. Both rugby clubs are among the few in the country to own their own pitch: Aardvark Park in Henrietta, New York, while the Colonials play their matches at Marianne Cope Parish in Henrietta, New York. The Aardvarks and the Colonials both have hosted local and statewide tournaments. The Rochester Colonials hosted the 2007 USA Rugby National Collegiate All-Star Championships, Rochester's first national tournament, as well as the 2009 NYS Rugby Upstates Tournament and the 2009 New York State High School Rugby Championships. Both teams participate in the annual Can-Am Rugby Tournament in Saranac Lake, New York in early August. Rochester also has a Women's Rugby club, the Rochester Renegades, who celebrated their 30th anniversary in 2017. The Renegades started the New York State Rugby Women's Division.[citation needed]

Some examples of Karivaradhan in media are https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/coimbatore-races-with-f3-track/articleshow/329149.cms and https://www.asianage.com/sports/in-other-sports/120819/the-indian-voice-of-formula-1.html. What is conclusive to me are three things. For one, a personal friend and race-driver uses this spelling at https://twitter.com/vickychandhok/status/1032845949901520896. Secondly, the meaning of the word is Kari (elephant) + vara (boon) + da (giver)+ -n, the Tamil masculine singular ending, referring to the Gajendra Moksa episode. Thirdly, the rdha cluster isn't actually legal in Tamil, for which I don't have an easy English reference unfortunately.

The latest version of it, GEBCO_2022 Grid, states ""The GEBCO Grid is placed in the public domain and may be used free of charge."" and ""Commercially exploit The GEBCO Grid, by, for example, combining it with other information, or by including it in their own product or application."" Does this mean, as long as proper credit is given, their copyright requirements no longer conflict with Wikipedia's copyright requirement and I can use the GEBCO_2022 Grid data with Global Mapper and graphic software to make Wikipedia figures for geology articles? Are there any Wikipedia administrators or editors who can answer this question for me? Paul H. (talk) 04:32, 30 December 2022 (UTC)"

See the book The First 100 IUGS Geological Heritage Sites (in PDF format) at https://iugs-geoheritage.org/videos-pdfs/iugs_first_100_book_v2.pdf  For the heritage sites that are already the subject of an article, it might be worth mentioning their new status in the article. For any sites that are not yet the topic of an article, the designation by IUGS probably indicates that they are notable (and probably were notable even before the designation).

[1]   He and Garcia were applying new age solutions to architectural issues faced from the aftermath of the revolution in Mexico at the same time of the muralist movement. [2] Obregon Santacilia was involved in the architectural community so much that he was made the president of the Sociedad de Arquitectos Mexicanos’. [3] Santacilia had introduced the contest in El Universal newspaper 1932 edition for who could come up with a progressive approach to housing that supported the working class. This promoted designs that would give better quality and spatial conditions for the proletariats to which a Juan Legaretta won first prize and his modernistic pueblo-styled buildings came to fruition in 1934.[4]

https://www.asiaone.com/football-hero-herisson	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2023_May_2	this	Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2023 May 2	Article about former footballer who played as an amateur except for two seasons in the S. League, which fails WP:GNG. The online coverage is almost entirely routine/trivial (match reports, injury reports, transfer annoucements), with a few minor exceptions. There are two Q&A interviews included in the article (one from October 2015 and one from December 2015) with the first one containing nearly zero independent reporting, and the second appears to provide little independent reporting other than repeating the information the subject provided in the October interview. Aside from that, there is non-routine, but not in-depth coverage of his play in Singapore such as this 2014 Singapore League Cup match report; so Hérisson did well for his club in that cup semi-final, but it never translated into significant coverage. Overall, there's just not enough coverage for a player who is no more than a curiosity (an amateur French footballer who played in Singapore). Jogurney (talk) 03:14, 18 April 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

I believe this to be misleading, for even if at occasional times it was referred to as such, as made apparent by 1 reference @Futhark raised, it is definitely not commonly referred to as such. As an orthodox jew I never heard it referred to as such, although every 5 year old orthodox jew will tell you Hebrew is Lashon Hakodesh. See the Mishna in Masechet Sotah 7:2-3 that refers to it as such. Indeed, the reason we refer to it as such has been discussed by early Jewish commentators, see Maimonides in Guide to the Perplexed 3:8, see also Nachmanides to Exodus 30:13, who both give reasons obviously only applicable to Hebrew. I believe the misconception we are discussing may have arose because of a statement of an early Jewish sage Rabbi Chanina quoted in the Talmud, Tractate Pesachim page 87b, where he states that Aramaic is akin to Lashon Hakodesh. Although from a Halachic (Jewish law) standpoint this may be the case, in practice only Hebrew is actually referred to as Lashon Hakodesh.

Premadasa was accused of corruption, favoritism, nepotism, as well as subverting the Constitution. The impeachment proceedings were later dismissed by Speaker of the Parliament M. H.

https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/ijoti.1940.14283	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Hill,_Croydon	Vaux Graham	Russell Hill, Croydon	On the northeast outskirts, at the south end of the Purley Way playing fields is Russell Hill reservoir. It was opened on 11th July 1923 by Croydon's mayor, Alderman T W Wood Roberts.[7] At that time Croydon Corporation was responsible for supplying the borough's sanitation.[8] Croydon's population growth and finite water sources meant there was a risk that peak demand could not be met, particularly during droughts. The corporation's engineer, George F Carter, had proposed a new reservoir at Russell Hill as early as 1911,[9] which was estimated to cost £91,000,[10] three times the cost of the newly opened Waddon pumping station.[9] The high cost caused delay while an independent report was commissioned by the consulting engineer Vaux Graham, an enquiry by the government's Local Government Board in 1913[11] and World War 1 fought; the final cost was £900,000.[7] Despite holding 10M gallons, over 10 times the capacity of the Park Hill reservoir it replaced, this represented just two days supply.[7] The reservoir supplied premises lower than the reservoir (Croydon's low-level district) with water from Waddon and Surrey Street pumping stations.[11]

An IP did this in November 2022. Though I haven't participated in the discussion regarding Dutch political parties, I did read through it and it seems like there's a similar case with these flags. These all appear to be logos put over some coloured background, though I did not find that as a problem. Like for the Dutch parties, ThecentreCZ did not provide any sources whatsoever to prove whether these flags actually exist. I've tried to find sources myself, though I was only able to find this for Alternativet that resembles something similar to a flag. Considering that I was unable to find sources specifically for the flags that ThecentreCZ uploaded, I've tagged the files with {{subst:nsd}} as the uploader would probably know the exact sources of the flags, if they are real of course. I've discussed with ThecentreCZ on my Commons talk page (see the discussion here) and from what ThecentreCZ said:

This book focused on the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences-winning political economist James McGill Buchanan and his work developing public choice theory, as well as the roles of Charles Koch and others in nurturing the libertarian movement in the United States. MacLean argued that these figures undertook ""a stealth bid to reverse-engineer all of America, at both the state and national levels back to the political economy and oligarchic governance of midcentury Virginia, minus the segregation.""[17] According to MacLean, Buchanan represents ""the true origin story of today’s well-heeled radical right.""[18]This work is controversial and while well received in certain left-leaning political circles has been criticized by people across the political spectrum. Maclean is accused of making assumptions and reaching conclusions on thin evidence, and in some cases, using no evidence or citations at all and projecting her assumptions onto her subject, it has been called sloppy history by some. NPR had to publish a follow up piece after interviewing Maclean, distancing itself from her and the book and clarifying that it learned of a number of problems and issues with her research after the interview and felt the need to address them and the numerous reader complaints they had received."

In August 1933, some six months after Hitler had become Reich Chancellor, Pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior, met with Dietrich Bonhoeffer and a few others to draft a new confession of faith, clarifying the grounds for resisting the Nazification of Germany, the Bethel Confession [Betheler Bekenntnis].[2] The resulting document, the Barmen Declaration, was an early form of resistance to Hitler, a rejection of Christian anti-Judaism and racist anti-Semitism,[2] though in practical terms it did nothing to impede the Nazis.[3] During the course of the T-4 Euthanasia Program, which ran in 1940 and 1941 and was aimed at exterminating physically and mentally disabled people, the staff at the institution were mainly in opposition to that crime of the National Socialist party. In 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered the gassing of all mental patients. The director of the hospital, pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior, resisted.[citation needed]

From the findings on a population-based study, there is about 37% increase in the likelihood of major depression among adolescents. In a different study conducted in 2007, those who used the most multiple social media platforms (7 to 11) had more than three times the risk of depression and anxiety than people who used the fewest (0 to 2).Not only has it increased depression and anxiety, but it also has increased the suicide rate of today’s youth and young adults, leading it to be the second leading cause of death among the ages 10-34.(source: https://www.newswise.com/articles/10-year-study-shows-elevated-suicide-risk-from-excess-social-media-time-for-teen-girls)

This is a very common issue between young people using certain apps and it continues to affect their personal well-being. Social media creates loneliness but finding someone to talk to can help ease the fear of missing out, which is why companionship is important and can decrease those feelings.

There is more to be added about the change in BMT plans re:Canal Street. Eventually, Clark Street Tunnel should be its own article. Also, the citations for IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line are really messed up and include self-published sources like nycsubway.org, and there is more history that could be added.

This time she was the valedictorian of her class at Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute.[10] In 1926 she moved to New York City, where she lived together with her sister in North Harlem. She attended the teachers college at Columbia University to study fine arts and art appreciation and received a bachelor's degree in 1930.[5][3] Among others, she took classes in interior design and home decoration and attended lectures, discussions, practical work and trips to museums which shaped her understanding of a modern design approach. During this time she also came in contact with the new negro movement and grew into it as a young, educated black woman who disagreed with the existing stereotypes. Moreover, she qualified herself as a member of the talented tenth, which after W.E.B. Du Bois was a group of culturally, socially and scientifically educated black Americans who would serve as sort of a mediator between blacks of lower education and the white society.[2] She returned to New York to gain her master's degree at Columbia University in 1934.[5][3]"

Relating to the original article: Raymond Michael Gaze - I have an expanded version here: User:Anjow/RMG. This was written by his biographer and shortened from the original here: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbm.2022.0026 -- I was asked to add it to his page since the original author did not know how to edit Wikipedia. The text and references were all provided by that author, which I've attempted to replicate here. I've seen the option to submit for review, however I didn't know if that was the right thing to do given it's to add to/replace an existing article - rather than an entirely new one. So my question is - is it correct to submit the draft for review, despite it being related to an existing stub article? Or is there a different way to get it reviewed?

Working for ABC, Mr. Goode gained notoriety while being stationed at the UN, reporting the responses of President John F. Kennedy to the Bay of Pigs Invasion initiative of Fidel Castro. Mr. Goode continued working as a Senior UN Correspondent for National Black Network until 1991 when the two largest African-American radio networks in American merged to form the American Urban Radio Networks, the Nation's only African-American owned and controlled radio network and the #1 Neilsen rated national audio network company reaching African Americans.

It is almost shocking that this work was incorporated through BLATANT COPY-PASTE in the article you mention, published in army.gr

https://www.industrial-bank.com/	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Arbor,_Maryland	Industrial Bank of Washington	Lake Arbor, Maryland	The story of Lake Arbor is emblematic of the socio-economic and demographic evolution of Prince George's County that occurred in the mid-1980s.[7] Against the strong resistance of many large national builders who perceived Prince George’s County as a price-sensitive retreat for urban African Americans who neither wanted nor could afford upscale amenities for their homes, community developers like Porten Sullivan, Pulte, Winchester, George T. Farrell of Morgan Investments and Jon Laria[8] from Laria Builders built features like two-car garages, brick, fronts and elaborate landscaping and built 2000 luxury homes in this community in the 1980's,[9] initiating a new path for the rest of Lake Arbor Community. Reynolds Real Estate acted as selling realtor and Industrial Bank of Washington provided construction and purchase financing. To the pleasant surprise of the builders, buyers rushed to embrace (and pay for) these features. Firmly demonstrating both the sophisticated tastes and buying power of the predominantly African American market, as well as codifying architectural standards requested (but not mandated) by county executives such as Winnie Kelly and Governor Parris Glendening, Lake Arbor established Prince George’s County as the most desirable destination for young, affluent African American families moving from Washington, DC for a suburban lifestyle.[10]

As per www.cttransit.com/about the divisions do not say ""Connecticut Transit"" - in fact, the only reason I bring this here is because the pages were moved in 2007 from ""a US postal abbreviation"", which although technically true gave the divisions inaccurate (or at least woefully outdated) names. I know the formatting is wrong but I'm new to all of this, so I wasn't quite sure what to do, but I am requesting all four divisions' articles below to be moved as well - template:requested move doesn't work here.

https://www.wsjhs.org/museum/people/sue-bird.html	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sue_Bird	https://www.wsjhs.org/museum/people/sue-bird.html	Talk:Sue Bird	Sue Bird is a public figure who is mainly recognized for her time as an American former professional basketball player. Sue Bird’s Wikipedia page mainly revolve around her life as an American athlete. While her basketball career has been covered substantially, many parts of her life such as her ancestry, sexual orientation, as well as her achievements pertaining to both, have not been covered. In her Early Life section, only two sentences cover Bird’s Jewish roots. Sue Bird is of Jewish-Russian descent. Bird’s grandfather migrated to the US via ship. He was one of the many migrants that landed at Ellis Island. Up until this point, their true family last name was Boorda. When he answered what his name was to people who asked, Sue says they would answer “Boorda? Bird. Now go on.” (https://www.wsjhs.org/museum/people/sue-bird.html). With relevance to her Professional Career and Overseas section, Sue’s Russian-Israeli-American heritage has allowed her to play in all three nations professional basketball leagues. She has represented all nations (Shattering The Glass: The Remarkable History Of Women's Basketball pg. 48). Sue Bird grew up in a multicultural household. Her father is Jewish and her mother is Protestant. Bird grew up celebrating both religions, Passover and Christmas (https://www.wsjhs.org/museum/people/sue-bird.html). However, after using her Israeli citizenship to play basketball overseas, she tapped into her Jewish roots. She lived in Tel Aviv and described her time as the “best experience” (https://www.wsjhs.org/museum/people/sue-bird.html).

Sue Bird’s Wikipedia page mainly revolve around her life as an American athlete. While her basketball career has been covered substantially, many parts of her life such as her ancestry, sexual orientation, as well as her achievements pertaining to both, have not been covered. In her Early Life section, only two sentences cover Bird’s Jewish roots. Sue Bird is of Jewish-Russian descent. Bird’s grandfather migrated to the US via ship. He was one of the many migrants that landed at Ellis Island. Up until this point, their true family last name was Boorda. When he answered what his name was to people who asked, Sue says they would answer “Boorda? Bird. Now go on.” (https://www.wsjhs.org/museum/people/sue-bird.html). With relevance to her Professional Career and Overseas section, Sue’s Russian-Israeli-American heritage has allowed her to play in all three nations professional basketball leagues. She has represented all nations (Shattering The Glass: The Remarkable History Of Women's Basketball pg. 48). Sue Bird grew up in a multicultural household. Her father is Jewish and her mother is Protestant. Bird grew up celebrating both religions, Passover and Christmas (https://www.wsjhs.org/museum/people/sue-bird.html). However, after using her Israeli citizenship to play basketball overseas, she tapped into her Jewish roots. She lived in Tel Aviv and described her time as the “best experience” (https://www.wsjhs.org/museum/people/sue-bird.html). In Bird’s Personal Life section, I would cover more about her involvement in the LGBTQ+ community. Sue Bird met her wife Megan Rapinoe (professional soccer player) at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyue	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vietnamese_irredentism	Nam Việt	Talk:Vietnamese irredentism	We believe the above details are true because the Greater Vietnam-ism of the Tây Sơn dynasty was cleverly inherited and applied by Emperor Gia Long (first emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty). He wanted to name the rename the country as “Nam Việt”, a former name of Vietnam which was then ruled by an old Chinese-Vietnamese Zhao dynasty. In 1802, he sent an envoy to Beijing to ask the Qing Dynasty to recognize this national name but failed (due to the fact that the territory of former Nam Việt also comprised a large territory in China, which the Qing emperor feared the rise of Vietnam-nationalism). Therefore, he had to change from “Nam Việt” to “Việt Nam” in 1804, but in 1813, the Nguyễn court returned to the name of Đại Việt. In 1839, Emperor Minh Mạng once again changed the country's name to Đại Nam (Great South). The Vietnamese used this name until 1945, when the name “Vietnam” have been reused as we see it today.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_nationalism	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vietnamese_irredentism	Chinese nationalism	Talk:Vietnamese irredentism	The main reason why nationalism have become so extreme among nowadays Vietnamese (even if the country is no longer at war) is probably because people use it as a tool against Chinese nationalism. But this shouldn’t be used because of how dangerous it can be. — Daeva Trạc (talk) 20:05, 2 May 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

https://americana-uk.com/	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Roby	Americana UK	Kenny Roby	"Kenny Roby is a singer-songwriter based in North Carolina.[1]  He was the former lead singer of 6 String Drag, which he formed with an old friend, bassist Rob Keller, in the early 1990s, becoming one of the main bands of the era's so-called Americana movement. The band's style ranged from old-style country with a hint of soul and gospel to rock. While 6 String Drag broke up in the late 1990s, Roby continues to make records and play live shows with the Mercy Filter, which includes Scott McCall of $2 Pistols. In 2013, Roby released the album Memories & Birds, which he described as ""almost a concept album"".[2] In 2015, Roby reunited the original members of 6 String Drag and released Roots Rock 'N' Roll, of which Roby says ""the songs kind of lent themselves to a 50’s and 60’s style.""[3]  Roby's latest album is The Reservoir, released in 2020.  The website Americana UK called the album ""A sparse, personal narrative built on pain, loss, and the hardships of life.""[4]"

In this context, the article considers the economic (i.e., cost-benefit) aspects of information security.

These forests provide an important habitat for numerous plant and animal species and are essential for nearly 4 million people, especially for community water supplies, agriculture and industry. They are also increasingly used as recreational areas. The changes in Puerto Rico's forests serve as a valuable model for understanding similar changes on other tropical islands as a result of human expansion. The island's forests have changed dramatically over the past two centuries as a result of the introduction of economically important crops and deforestation for grazing and charcoal production. Today, forests and old agricultural lands are disappearing due to urbanization and development. Puerto Rico's forests are highly diverse in terms of location and type, and the diversity of forest types has yet to be fully documented (https://data.fs.usda.gov/research/pubs/iitf/iitf_gtr_35.pdf)

This type of etymological claim is very common on internet forums (it reminds me of stuff like this [5] about the name ""Alexander"" supposedly having a similar origin), but has no place here. This is a medium visibility article, and the standard for inclusion should be high. Any major controversial major inclusion, such as this, needs to be decided by community consensus.

However, it's likely astronomer Уральская Валентина Семеновна, who curates the site, copied the symbol from Wikipedia: if you follow the Eris link you'll see they use the WP image of the mythological Eris,[1] and all three symbols (Ceres, Pluto and Eris) look like they could be gifs of the WP glyphs. — kwami (talk) 00:45, 25 April 2023 (UTC)

https://www.eastidahonews.com/2012/12/conn-elementary-school-shooting-20-children-seven-adults-killed/	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting	East Idaho News	Talk:Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting	"Kaitlin Roig, the teacher who hid the students in the classroom bathroom, stated in a 2012 interview the day of or the day after that there were 15 students.CTNews.com quoting ABC News interview
Roig also states in her book, mentioned above and published in 2015, that there were 15 students present that day.""An adult wouldn’t fit comfortably. How in God’s name will I get sixteen of us in there?"" (meaning her plus 15 children) Many of the sources above are from 2015 and are interviews about Roig's book. Seems to me, to keep the information clean and verifiable, that the book itself should be the source, not interviews that simply repeat information about the book.
As to the number possibly being 14...the Mason County Daily News article cited above - published several days after the shooting, on December 18, 2012 - does state 14 as the number of students hidden in Roig's classroom but it also says Lanza's mother was killed in two places - dead at home and also dead in a classroom while working as an aide. The  prime source seems to be an ABC News Radio report but snippets of the exact same wording can be found on East Idaho News in an article published the day after the massacre.
In my opinion, the person who was there, the eyewitness should be relied upon to know how many children hid in that bathroom with her. Shearonink (talk) 22:26, 2 May 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]"

Trains Magazine writes in 1994 that the Southbridge Branch was still active, but seldom used (see the map on page 60). This of course contradicts Karr's 1988 end of service. I do know Scott Hartley directly talked to at least some people at P&W in writing the story, but Karr is generally very reliable. Trainsandotherthings (talk) 22:12, 2 May 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]
https://www.hmc.ox.ac.uk	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_the_University_of_Oxford	https://www.hmc.ox.ac.uk	Degrees of the University of Oxford	The BTh is awarded primarily to students of the various theological colleges and halls, such as Wycliffe Hall, Regent's Park College, Blackfriars, St Stephen's House, Ripon College Cuddesdon,[4] Harris Manchester College (https://www.hmc.ox.ac.uk) and the former Westminster College, Oxford. Usually, these students are candidates for the ordained ministry of one of the mainstream Christian denominations, but may be drawn from any faith background (Unitarian ordinands study at HMC) or none at the discretion of the College or Hall. It should not be confused with the degree of bachelor of divinity (BD), which is a postgraduate degree.

Some support for the common name claim: The company is listed as ""Pictures"" in Variety's profile on the executive, an old Variety article, an IndieWire article, Deadline often just uses ""Thunder Road"", but they also use ""Pictures"", and The Hollywood Reporter etc.  I know we use what RS use, but FWIW, they seem to refer to themselves as Thunder Road Pictures as well.

https://www.artbasel.com/miami-beach	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafa_Esparza	Miami Beach Art Basel	Rafa Esparza	"In 2020, Rafa Esparza collaborated with Eamon Ore-Giron and Gala Porras-Kim for the Art Basel 2020; their exhibition was also featured at Commonwealth and Council Gallery. This exhibition featured Esparza’s paintings that were created on Adobe- his artwork was dedicated to confronting white supremacy through the history of colonial violence. While also connecting to the indigenous people of the Americas and their connection to the land. Esparza created a painting of his older brother that showed him in a nostalgic rendition of a pre-Instagram photograph.[25] Esparza has also created painted works on adobe that evoke the fantasies and real-world experiences of the Latinx queer community.[26][27]
November 30, 2022 for Miami Beach Art Basel L.A Times Image Magazine, Commonwealth and Council art gallery collaborated with rafa esparza on his performance of ""Corpo RanfLA: Terra Cruiser”[28] . The performance consisted of an out of commission repurposed 25 cent mechanical ride that was transformed into a cyborg lowrider cruiser. People that were given a ticket to ride the listened to a recording of esparza recounting a story of creating CorpoRanfLA and the passage of time. This piece was one of the few that was not for sale at Art Basel, It was for performance only. Fellow riders included L.A. artists Gabriela Ruiz, Karla Canseco, Victor Barragán, and Rosales, all of whom had helped bring the piece together.[29] This exhibition builds upon a previous performance he had done in collaboration with Mario Ayala, Tanya Melendez, Paul Marcus Rodriguez and Fabian Guerrero titled ""Corpo ranfla, 2018"". For that performance esparza was spray painted fuchsia pink, detailed with roses, and various portraits to resemble the infamous lowrider Gypsy Rose. Esparza’s 2018 performance was an ode to the intersexuality of queer lowrider culture that he experienced. He used his body to display himself as a kind of human lowrider, welcoming sexualization by typically hyper-masculine men. Alongside him on stage were Fabian Guerrero as his photographer and Sebastian Hernandez acting as the model displaying the lowrider. They wanted to take back the feeling of not being welcomed in these car shows due to the toxic environment. [30] In lowrider culture they take the paint jobs of their cars very seriously, thinking of it as its own artform and beauty. [31] Esparza paid homage to this by recreating his favorite car at the time, Gypsy Rose. This exhibition explored the public gay cruising sites that intersected with public lowrider cruising sites. This performance expressed the different connotations of the word ""cruising"". The performance started at Elysian Park in Los Angeles where many car enthusiasts cruise with their lowriders, but also many gay men cruise for sexual encounters. This location was the perfect intersection for both worlds. To end this performance esparza performed a dance alongside Sebastián Hernández at the Mayan Theater.[32] Both of these performances focus on how there is lacking feminine and queer expression in this hyper-masculine space.[33]"

The schedule I had added is from this link https://www.visitkc.com/big-12/championship-schedule-information. With a 14 team tournament, the format would follow the formats of the recent SEC or Big 10 tournaments for reference. The 11-14 seeds would play on Tuesday, the 5-10 seeds and the two first round winners would play Wednesday, and the top 4 seeds and the four winners from the second round would play in the quarterfinals on Thursday. So Kansas is either going to play in the first round on Tuesday, March 12th (exceedingly unlikely), in the second round Wednesday, March 13th (probably not) or the quarterfinals on Thursday, March 14th (most likely).

The film chronicles the life of a homeless person, Marc, who lives in his car in New York City. The film premiered at the 45th Duisburger Filmwoche, where it received the Arte-Dokumentarfilmpreis (ARTE Documentary Award) for the year 2021.[14] Phuong Le in The Guardian called it a commendably transparent documentary. Over the period of nearly 20 years, Petschnig's artworks and videos have been featured in multiple exhibitions and film festivals including the International Film Festival Rotterdam and Anthology Film Archives.[15][16] She has also given talks on her work at Columbia University, Vassar College, The Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA), Moscow, National Centre for Contemporary Arts, Yekaterinburg and The New School.

Tatsoomaki was born somewhere, I don't know where because I am not some creep who doxes people.Tatsoomaki or rather Tatsoo is known to be a naturally funny gamer and a artist who lost some of his hard work in a tragic accident called Computer wiping it's out ass too hard. Tatsoo has worked hard to build up a community (not cult) that adores everything he does, like summoning the raw energy of Goblin mode (I swear it's not a cult! Please trust me!). He originally built the community off of his love of the Kingdom Farts game series, but has expanded to stuff like Fighting germs and Your dad jokes. Tatsoo often plays video games in his free time but he also plays them on stream where wacky goofy goober adjacent esque antics ensue. The antics range anything from playing DDD (Drunk Dragon Daddy) at level one, to wearing maid outfits while playing Silent hill. He is also known to like putting Mickey Mouse plushies in jars of milk until they stink after a good session of playing Epic Mickey. He once ran the one hit wonder of a game show called PEZ YOUR PANTS but it sadly only lasted 1 short episode where he had a mental breakdown due to the sheer amount of PEZ.

Morocco has become a major player in African economic affairs, and is the 5th largest African economy by GDP (PPP).

There are several competing standards for what constitutes positive development in adulthood, which can be broadly grouped into five directions;[15] orthogenetic (becoming more hierarchically complex), selective/adaptive (becoming more likely to pass on your genes and for offspring to survive and thrive), veridical (becoming less biased in your view of the world), eudemonic (becoming happier and healthier) and virtuous (becoming a better person from a particular moral or ethical standpoint).

These touch points help the brand to develop a point of contact between themselves and the consumer. Modern day advancements in various forms of technology have made it easier for consumers to engage with brands in numerous ways. The most successful touch points are those that create value in the consumer and brands relationship.[27] Common examples of touch points include social media links, QR codes, person handing out flyers about a particular brand, billboards, web sites and various other methods that connect the brand and consumer. The most effective touch points, as found in Effie Award- winning campaigns, are: interactive (91%), followed by TV (63%), print (52%) and consumer involvement (51%).[28]

https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ducksarethebestbird/Voting_behavior	U.S. Cooperative Congressional Election Study	User:Ducksarethebestbird/Voting behavior	Black women in the United States are much more likely than White women and then Black men to vote for Democratic candidates, a trend that has persisted since the 1960’s,[61][62] and are far more likely to vote than their income would predict.[63] While income usually is associated with propensity to vote, this does not appear to hold true for Black women.[63] Analyses of data from the U.S. Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a large survey that matches respondents to their voter file records, has found that low income Black women have a significantly higher predicted voting rate compared to Black men, White men, or White women in the same income category.[63] While the researchers found that income did strongly predict voting participation among White people, it played less of a role in voter participation among Black women.[63] Some have theorized that this increased voter participation occurs because voting and other civic engagement are ways of coping with the stress of persistent racial discrimination.[64][65]

WOW. I just found about about them like a year ago. Usualy I hate advertising on Wikipedia and would probably report, but for this page it to only seems appropriate but it actually educates the public to more companies and how or why they work. I thought the only reason consumer cellular wasn't as big as at&t was because it catered to old seniors who used flip phones and didn't use data (and wanted unlimited talk and text). If its like cricket, boost mint etc I don't get how these companies don't dominate the cell phone industry. Why would anyone pay version, at&t or t-mobile directly when its soooo much more expensive, and also they usually charge huge dees were as MVNO's are known for either no fees (and taxes included) or really really small extremely reasonable ones like $1-a few dollars (for 911 calling or sales tax)Reply[reply]

https://www.npr.org/2022/08/22/1118635642/abortion-trigger-ban-tennessee-idaho-texas	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law	[1]	Abortion law	Roe V. Wade has been established in the US for almost 50 years, put into motion in 1973,  before its overturn in 2022 due to Dobbs v. Jackson. This ruling made abortion access not a constitutional right. The decision, most of which was leaked in early May, means that abortion rights will be rolled back in nearly half of the states immediately, with more restrictions likely to follow. For all practical purposes, abortion will not be available in large swaths of the country.[1] 13 States, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming enacted a trigger law which placed an immediate but varying statewide abortion ban immediately following the overturning. These trigger laws were designed specifically to take effect immediately upon the fall of the Roe precedent. Other states, were bans are in effect after 6 weeks gestation, including Idaho, Tennessee, and Texas – have similar laws, which would take effect after 30 days of the overturning.[2][46]
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/abortion-pill-lawsuit-mifepristone-questions-future-access-rcna79455	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law	[3]	Abortion law	Pill abortion access is legal in 36 states. However, a lawsuit in Texas is currently against the production and distribution of this Abortion pill, misoprostol. The ban would affect millions of women in the US who cannot access a medical procedural abortion due to a state ban. The group suing the FDA has asked for a preliminary injunction to take one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion, mifepristone, off the market while the case plays out.[3] This will effectively cause a nationwide ban of pill abortion if granted.[47]
https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/03/23/el-salvador-court-hears-case-total-abortion-ban	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law	[4]	Abortion law	El Salvador has some of the strictest abortion laws of any country. Abortion under all circumstances, including rape, incest, and risk to the mothers health, is illegal. Women can be criminalized and penalized to up to 40 years in prison after being found guilty of an abortion. El Salvador's abortion laws are so severe that miscarriages and stillbirths can sometimes be enough for conviction. The Inter-American Court has already ruled that El Salvador was responsible for the death of Manuela, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2008 for aggravated homicide after suffering an obstetric emergency that resulted in her losing her pregnancy.[4][550] Lack of access to abortion is recognized by Uruguay, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia as a human rights issue. This shows progress in underdeveloped nations.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36662440/	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ricazevedo/sandbox	Professor Luiz R. Travassos	Draft:Carlos Rogério Figueiredo	Figueiredo completed his Ph.D. in Immunology and Microbiology under the guidance of Professor Luiz R. Travassos at the Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil. Professor Travassos was also a tenured Professor at the Memorial Sloan Kattering Cancer Center together with the his collaborator and friend, Professor Lloyd J. Old, considered the Father of Modern Tumor Immunology[1]. Travassos introduced Figueiredo to immunochemistry and cancer immunobiology during his Ph.D. studies in Brazil, which shaped his future research and teaching. Figueiredo's research led to the discovery of new antitumor drugs, such as small peptides derived from immunoglobulins and monoclonal antibodies with antitumor functions against advanced metastatic tumors[2]. During his postdoctoral studies at the University of Liverpool, Figueiredo furthered his understanding of the mechanisms behind antitumor immunotherapies he had developed and fostered collaboration in combinatorial drug development[3][4][5]. In a subsequent postdoctoral period, Figueiredo gained advanced training in precision cancer pathology under the mentorship of Professor Sarah E. Coupland. His training focused on interpreting immune infiltrates in tumor biopsies from cancer patients, including ocular melanomas and tumors that develop metastases in the liver. While training in Liverpool, Figueiredo received funding from the North West Cancer Research to conduct reverse translational clinical research, primarily centered on applying single-cell mass cytometry and spatial NanoString GeoMX to immune profiling of metastatic ocular melanomas resistant to immune checkpoint therapies. In Finland, Figueiredo worked as a postdoc at the MediCity research laboratory at the University of Turku, and was later awarded a docentship in immunology by the same Institution.

De Anza club catagories: •Academics •Community Service •Diversity •Political •Religious •Special Interest •Sports •Support Also noting the fact that there is one club day every quarter. In addition, the statement in the De Anza wiki page ""One of the well known internships they have available to its students is at the NASA Ames Research Center."" is not true anymore because of the budget cuts it has been revoked. But the OTI ( Occupational Training Institute ) in deanza is still active and provides internship for computer major studens in one of its program called CalTechs.

I did see the twitter post Ren made saying CNN made the correction to include that statement,. I never saw the corrected report, only the original, so it can't put a viewed date for the corrected version and they don't have an edit log like Wikipedia. I'm going to use Ren's post to support the statement for now since it is information he would be expected to know. If you have a better citation, please use it instead..

""Individuals use different criteria when voting, based on the type of election it is. Therefore, voting behavior is also conditional to the election which is held. Different factors are in play in a national election vs. a regional election based on the voter's preferred outcome. For each individual, the order of importance of factors like loyalty, satisfaction, employment, gender, religion and class may look very different in a national or regional elections, even when the elections occur with relatively similar candidates, issues and time frames. For example, religion may play a larger role in a national election than in regional one, or vice versa. The importance of the location in which these types of elections occur in an urban or rural environment is an additional factor to voter mindset.""

(We'll have to come up with a good title; I've based the first on P. M. W. Robinson (1989). ""Collation and Textual Criticism of Icelandic Manuscripts (1): Collation"". Literary and Linguistic Computing. Retrieved 4 May 2023.). This could be along the lines of Textual criticism of the New Testament and Textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible (and the book Textual Criticism and Qurʼān Manuscripts). Earlier this morning I also suggested at Talk:Rus' chronicle to create an article called Textual criticism of the Rus' chronicles for the same purpose."

The influences of class voting is reliant on political environment and location, many nations observe the opposite preferences.[13][12]

Firstly, the second ref is https://sites.google.com/site/300orgsite/300-org---return-atmosphere-co2-to-300-ppm/. Say no more. Secondly, the Nature thing doesn't say 300. It proposes 350. But rather more importantly, its just an article in Nature. Which is prestigious and all that, but one article isn't The current scientific consensus. If you could find the IPCC saying that it would be different; but it doesn't, so it isn't William M. Connolley (talk) 22:52, 23 March 2015 (UTC)

I found this which says
http://www.csiro.au/news/ps2im.html	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere/Archive_1	[15]	Talk:Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere/Archive 1	"Over the last months, I have included information about the rise of the growth rate. Namely the doubling of the growth rate from 41.6±0.5 years ago. Please note the following caveats.
Interpreting the data as an exponential, as used in the article, gives 259ppm as the historical baseline, which is 20 ppm lower than historical. When using 280ppm, the main difference is that the doubling time decreases to 31.7+-0.067. The significant difference indicates that the data is not purely exponential with a 280 ppm historical baseline, which nevertheless has been established pretty well using other data. Note that the doubling time becomes much more accurate when this data is included, and has been done in [15](probably wrong reference). The doubling time in the article is thus more conservative than in this reference."

It mentions 31, 35 and 40 year doubling times. To me these are all pretty close anyway.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.169.251.18 (talk) 08:07, 24 January 2011 (UTC)
http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/pdf/tar-03.pdf	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere/Archive_1	[18]	Talk:Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere/Archive 1	From the IPCC Third Assessment Report (admittedly dated, but it probably hasn't that changed much), the emissions from 1989 to 1998 were 7.9 GtC/yr (6.3 fossil fuels and cement, 1.6 land use change).  Of that, 2.3 +/- 0.5 GtC/yr went to the oceans, 2.3 +/- 1.3 GtC/yr went to the biosphere, and 3.3 +/- 0.1 GtC/yr remained in the atmosphere.  [18]  In rough terms, that translates to 30% oceans, 30% biosphere, and 40% atmosphere.  Those percentages will change some over time, and it is not uncommon for people to say that about half of the CO2 stays in the atmosphere (somewhat above the IPCC number), but I don't think 60-70% is a realistic number for the atmospheric fraction.  Also, this applies to the short-term fraction.  On time scales longer than the ~1000 yr ocean mixing time, the ocean swallows 80-90% of the emissions, leaving only 5-15% in the air.

To better explain my point.  H20, ""on average"" exists in the ""troposhere"" in the 1.5% to 3.0% levels or (15,000 ppmv to 30,000 ppmv) range. (http://www.netl.doe.gov/KeyIssues/climate_change3.html)   Even if all other greehouse gases are ignored, CO2 concentrations of 400 ppmv when compared only to water vapor would represent only 2.7% to 1.3% of all of the greenhouse gas.  This is a key issue since CO2 and H2O both absorb IR energy in the 2.7 and 15 micron spectra. Therefore, most of the IR energy which is reflected from the earth in these two IR spectra will be absorbed by H2O.  The only spectra att which CO2 uniquely absorbs IR energy is a narrow band centered at 4.7 microns.    http://brneurosci.org/co2.html"
